## Usage

### Enviroment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository using the `.env.example` template.

To run this service, the [Polymarket NBA Oracle](https://github.com/etchedheadplate/polymarket-nba-oracle) and [Polymarket NBA Report](https://github.com/etchedheadplate/polymarket-nba-report) services must be deployed first.

To obtain `TG_BOT_TOKEN` use BotFather (see [Telegram Bot Documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token)).

### Running

The system is built around a RabbitMQ-based task processing model. A consumer subscribes to task queues, executes incoming tasks, and publishes results back to response queues.

Start Telegram bot with RabbitMQ consumer:

```bash
python -m main
```
